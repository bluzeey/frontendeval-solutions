from the West Coast (Bay Area) to the East Coast (NYC). Their team consists of a current-Airbnb frontend engineer, ex-Google, ex-Airbnb frontend engineer, and an Amazon frontend engineer. They started this project out of their frustration towards the lack of frontend-specific interview resources. Theyâ€™ve done plenty of interviews in our time, securing offers in recent years from companies like Lyft, Stripe, Square, and Netflix, and are hoping to share some of their interviewing through this website.

I am currently creating a repository with all the solutions to their challenges.
